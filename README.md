# anaoaktree.github.io
My personal dev site. Built with [html5 boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) and template from [freehtml5.co](freehtml5.co)


Note that the html is very basic, verbose (given it was copied from an existing template) and dumb (no backend!)In order to take advantage of the github pages functionality.
